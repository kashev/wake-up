## Features of Agile Design
- Fast, iterative design vs. design it, build it, test it, it's done, Waterfall style
    - design in your browser
- Focus on user design
    - much less of an emphasis on making something that can't be explained by user need
- in web & mobile, the system needs to be made to be used, not simply to look pretty.
- repeatedly and decidedly iterative
    - nothing set in stone; not necessarily one giant project release
    - Facebook style rollouts - 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%
- 'we build what our users want'
- reactive and adaptive vs predictive
- Ship a Minimum Viable Product (get it working first)
    - sometimes called iteration zero - http://peterschuh.com/?p=129
    - 90% Solutions
- high amounts of communication between developers, designers, and customers

## Discussion Questions

1. What is agile design? What differentiates it from other types of design? Why is agile design something designers should be aware of?

Traditional design work is akin to traditional enterprise-style of doing software, called Waterfall.  This is done by first designing (perhaps in Photoshop), then building it, then showing it to the client. In contrast, agile design looks to speed up this process. Rather than first designing everything, then building it all, these phases are split into many smaller 1-2 week sprints during which design and building may be done simultaneously. Rather than showing the final design to the clients when it is completed, designers and developers instead reach smaller mile stones (sometimes called Minimum Viable Products), show these to clients frequently throughout the project, and then adapt to client needs and feelings about the current design. This can mean the difference between 1 week of work needing to be redone as opposed to a 6 month redesign. Finally, in large projects, this attitude towards clients is extended to other teams and people working towards the same goal. Different parts are tried together more frequently, rather than different parts coming together at the end of the project and ending up disparate. An Agile system values people and interactions over processes for the sake of processes.

Agile has become prevalent in the web software development world, and is trickling down to other kinds of software teams. Designers need to be aware of and able to work in an Agile system for one fundamental reason: much design is being done on the web. Because this is how development teams work, to effectively insert themselves into these teams and make attractive products, designers need to be agile.


2. What are user personas? What format do they take? Provide an example. Where are they most useful in the design process, and how do designers use them to design more effectively?

3. What are user stories? What format do they take? Provide an example. Where are they most useful in the design process, and how do designers use them to design more effectively?

5. What role do the tasks you will engage with in this project have in the design process? Does the design process differ for both interactive design and non-interactive design? If so, how and why?


# Project Questions

## 1. Your personal interpretation of the assertion made by Bolter and Gromala

When I open a digital application, even if it is subconsciously, I judge its design. Even as someone who is not a designer by trade, the first thing that I do is appraise the design of what I'm looking at. A good first impression is the key difference between me believing that an application can accomplish for me what it sets out do, and closing it and never looking at it again. This is an example of the application being very 'revealed'; the application opens, and makes a strong statement.

Once this statement is over, then good applications take a completely different tact, and hide behind their functionality. Their good design becomes subtle and unnoticed by the user. It is clear to the user how to navigate through the app without the buttons or action elements detracting from the information being displayed. Good digital interaction design does not get in the way of the ultimate purpose.


## 2. A general description of each application, including any relevant technical details

For this project, I picked two Android Alarm Clock applications: Timely and Warmly. I picked Android because despite generally being thought of as an ecosystem rife with applications of a sub-par design quality compared to the iOS ecosystem, Android has 80% market share, so these applications are easily available to a large population of Android users. Finally, everyone needs to wake up in the morning; Alarm clocks are universally experienced. I feel a survey of the design of these two beautiful applications could be appreciated not only by designers, but by anyone who needs to wake up.

Timely is a full featured Clock application that can replace the default clock application that ships with any Android device (and it in fact might soon; it was recently bought by Google). The design is decidedly unlike Google's recent flat design language. It features a multicolor, customizable, animated background with mostly translucent design elements. Interactions like setting an alarm or timer time are predominantly gesture controlled (with traditional push button fall backs). These gestures cause more animations. Furthermore, the alarms are highly customizable; the sounds are changeable, the days that the alarm sounds are customizable, and the app even allows for custom puzzles to be set to reduce the likelihood of turning off the alarm without actually waking up..

Unlike Timely, Warmly is not what would be called a "fully featured" Android clock application. It does not seek to provide stopwatches or timers, and doesn't even allow for multiple alarms to be set at different times. It only seeks to fulfill one purpose: to provide a pleasant wake-up experience. The alarms sounds are derived from real life, rather than the futuristic alarm tones of Timely. The design language is decidedly flat; UI elements are stark rectangles, and placed on a lot of yellow 'whitespace'. Finally, the alarm screen delivers information about the weather, and aims to slowly coax people using the app out of bed pleasantly.


## 3. A description of how each application demonstrates the assertion made by Bolter and Gromala

Timely opens strongly by having a striking appearance that looks almost alien on the Android operating system. The background is animated and bubbly; an iOS7 trojan horse. This all disappears into being a background when an alarm is set. The mechanism for doing this is with a swipe, which is in many ways more natural than traditional soft button touching. Timers are set in a way that recalls twisting a dial, except with a single finger. Switching between functions only requires a swipe across the screen. The usage of the app is easy, intuitive, and while well designed, does not feel over-designed.

Warmly is not nearly as feature filled, and doesn't care to hide this fact. The first thing a user will notice is the bold yellow color, reminiscent of the sun. The user is asked to turn on the app, then the alarm setting screen comes up. Holding the alarm sound buttons starts a preview of the sound. Time setting is intuitive to Android users (the time picker isn't unique like the one in Timely). However, once the time is set, the app knows that its task is done. It displays a dark bedside clock until the alarm goes off, or the screen is tapped, and the app yields control of the screen to the Android operating system, quite literally transitioning from showing itself to hiding itself.


## 4. 2+ example user personas for each application

The title of this project is "Everyone Needs to Wake Up". As such, the user personas that could be considered for these two apps are just people who need to wake up.

### Eric

Eric is a college freshman who did poorly last semester. The main reason? He had trouble waking up for his 8:00 AM classes. Well, it's his first spring semester, the earliest he's got class is 9:00 AM, he just needs to wake up for it.

#### Reasons Eric Might Use Timely
- He is a heavy sleeper. The alarm is loud, which wakes him up, the snooze is configurable to be shorter with every snooze, and there are puzzles to make sure he's functioning and not just going through the motions.
- He needs to time himself. Timely has a timer feature that allows him to make sure he's getting through his morning ablutions quickly.
- He has class at different times on different days. Timely allows him to set separate alarms with separate repeating patterns. He can even select different sounds.
- The interface is intuitive. He grew up in the computer age, so after a quick tutorial, setting alarms is effortless.

#### Reasons Eric Might Use Warmly
- He doesn't like to be jarred awake. Warmly's natural alarm sounds, which build in volume by design, allow Eric to wake up over the course of 5 minutes or so, rather than all at once.
- He misses home. Warmly's breakfast sounds remind him of his mother's bacon!
- He wants simple. Eric might not want to spend all of his time setting alarms, trying to make sure he can sleep until the absolute last possible minute. He just wants to wake up every day, and Warmly allows him to easily set a single, recurring alarm.

### Becky

Becky is a manager at a large company, a mom with 2 kids, a loving wife, and a homemaker, and just got her first smartphone. She is looking to replace her aging alarm clock with something more high tech. She's going to impress her kids.

#### Reasons Becky Might Use Timely
- It reminds her of her husband's iPhone. Which is very pretty.
- She need to remind herself to do things during the day. Because she can name alarms in Timely, she can use alarms to remind herself to attend her meetings, even when she's not looking at her Outlook calendar. She can even use multiple alarms to remind her when she needs to pick up her daughter from dance class.
- She needs to have a convenient timer for both her baking and her pomodoro time management. Timely has a robust timer that is easy to set one handed.

#### Reasons Becky Might Use Warmly

- She doesn't really know her way around her phone yet. Unlike Timely, Warmly is pretty obvious to navigate, and doesn't require a tutorial.
- She doesn't want to wake her husband sleeping when she wakes up. Warmly's gentle sounds wake her up, but don't affect her husband's slumber.
- She wants a bed time clock to replace her old alarm clock. After she's set her Warmly alarm, the dark clock on the dark screen displayed is perfect for propping up on her nightstand while she charges her phone at night.
- She wants to know the weather so she can know how to dress herself. Warmly's alarm screen displays weather information based on current location.
