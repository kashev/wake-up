- Fast, iterative design vs. design it, build it, test it, it's done, Waterfall style
    - design in your browser
- Focus on user design
    - much less of an emphasis on making something that can't be explained by user need
- in web & mobile, the system needs to be made to be used, not simply to look pretty.
- repeatedly and decidedly iterative
    - nothing set in stone; not necessarily one giant project release
    - Facebook style rollouts - 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%
- 'we build what our users want'
- reactive and adaptive vs predictive
- Ship a Minimum Viable Product (get it working first)
    - sometimes called iteration zero - http://peterschuh.com/?p=129
    - 90% Solutions
- high amounts of communication between developers, designers, and customers

1. What is agile design? What differentiates it from other types of design? Why is agile design something designers should be aware of?

Traditional design work is akin to traditional enterprise-style of doing software, called Waterfall.  This is done by first designing (perhaps in Photoshop), then building it, then showing it to the client. In contrast, agile design looks to speed up this process. Rather than first designing everything, then building it all, these phases are split into many smaller 1-2 week sprints during which design and building may be done simultaneously. Rather than showing the final design to the clients when it is completed, designers and developers instead reach smaller mile stones (sometimes called Minimum Viable Products), show these to clients frequently throughout the project, and then adapt to client needs and feelings about the current design. This can mean the difference between 1 week of work needing to be redone as opposed to a 6 month redesign. Finally, in large projects, this attitude towards clients is extended to other teams and people working towards the same goal. Different parts are tried together more frequently, rather than different parts coming together at the end of the project and ending up disparate. An Agile system values people and interactions over processes for the sake of processes.

Agile has become prevalent in the web software development world, and is trickling down to other kinds of software teams. Designers need to be aware of and able to work in an Agile system for one fundamental reason: much design is being done on the web. Because this is how development teams work, to effectively insert themselves into these teams and make attractive products, designers need to be agile.

2. What are user personas? What format do they take? Provide an example. Where are they most useful in the design process, and how do designers use them to design more effectively?

3. What are user stories? What format do they take? Provide an example. Where are they most useful in the design process, and how do designers use them to design more effectively?

4. What are use cases? How are they typically visualized, and what components are involved? Provide an example. Where are they most useful in the design process, and how do designers use them to design more effectively?

5. What role do the tasks you will engage with in this project have in the design process? Does the design process differ for both interactive design and non-interactive design? If so, how and why?
