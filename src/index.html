      <h1>This Project</h1>

      <p>For this project, I chose to compare two relatively popular Android alarm clock applications: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely">Timely</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaoscollective.warmly">Warmly</a>. I think alarm clocks are an interesting thing to investigate because of their simplicity and pervasiveness. These apps in particular are on on the platform <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/29/strategy-analytics-2013-smartphone-share/">with the most market share</a>, so are available to the vast majority of those who use their phones. Combined with the fact that <a href="http://www.prleap.com/pr/208911/">83 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 use their mobile phones to wake up in the morning</a>, it's likely that Timely and Warmly could be considered by a variety of people looking to just Wake Up.</p>

    <!-- THE TIMELY APPROACH -->
    <section>
      <h1>The Timely Approach</h1>

      <img src="img/timely_icon.webp" alt="Timely Icon">
      <p>You know the stock alarm clock that came with your phone? Timely wants you to never open that again. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/4/5273474/google-acquires-bitspin-timely">(Google might too.)</a> The design, however, is decidedly unlike Google's recent flat design language that it has brought to Android. It features a multicolor, customizable, animated background with mostly translucent design elements. One of the key differentiators is the interaction design. Actions like setting an alarm or timer duration are predominantly gesture controlled (with traditional push button fall backs).</p>

      <p>Timely is an everything and the kitchen sink type alarm clock application, like the stock one it aims to replace. It has not only an alarm clock, but also a clock intended to use on a dock, a stopwatch, and a timer. The alarms are highly customizable; the sounds are changeable, the days that the alarm sounds are customizable, and the app even allows for custom puzzles to be set to reduce the likelihood of turning off the alarm without actually waking up.</p>

    <!-- THE WARMLY APPROACH -->
    <section>
      <h1>The Warmly Approach</h1>

      <img src="img/warmly_icon.webp" alt="Warmly Icon">
      <p>Warmly doesn't want to replace the timer application on your phone. In fact, it wants you to spend as little time with it open as possible.</p>
